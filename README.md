# CoDEx-1.0.0

A Mathematica package to calculate the Wilson Coefficients of SMEFT operators (up to dimension - 6) to connect some Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theory with weak scale precision observables, using Covariant Derivative Expansion. Works for single and multiple degenerate heavy field propagators, at tree and one-loop level.
